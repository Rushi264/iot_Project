# 🌐 CIS600 Assignment 3 - IoT with ThingSpeak

This project demonstrates a virtual IoT system using Python in Google Colab that sends simulated environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, and CO₂) to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com) using HTTP API.

## 🔧 Features
- Generates random virtual sensor data
- Sends data to ThingSpeak using the Write API Key
- Displays the latest recorded values
- Fetches sensor values from the last 5 hours

## 📁 Files
- `CIS600_Assignment3_ThingSpeak.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the code
- `CIS600_Assignment3_Report.md`: Report template with explanation, screenshots placeholder, reflection

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Replace your Write API Key and Channel ID if different
3. Run the cells top to bottom
4. View your live data on ThingSpeak dashboard

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
Hands-on experience with IoT sensor simulation, ThingSpeak integration, and RESTful API communication for real-time cloud data storage.
